<h2>Bachelor of Arts in Communications</h2>
<p1> My name is Cody Fakhoorian and I am 20 years old. I grew up in a small town in Kentucky with 7 older brothers and one younger sister.
I've always had a sense of independency growing up, my parents divorced when I was around the age of 7. Since then, I've helped my younger sister and even my older brothers by cooking and getting my younger sister to school on time. 
In my current job, I help train the new delivery drivers on the prepping and the right script talk for handling customers. I believe what I can bring to your company is delegation and leadership not often found outside the workplace.
 My interests are Computer Technology and teaching music. I am a huge advocate for Arts across America's schools, I have been a performer for 9 years, my primary instrument is singing for my choir and percussion for my band. I teach private lessons when I'm not working at my main job. I love helping my students, and love seeing their reactions to music's power and beauty. I also have a deep interest in childcare and I love babysitting
 my adorable 8 year old niece, my 5 and 4 year old nephews.</p>
<p2>My goals in life currently are finding what I shine at outside of music and moving north after graduation. I love city life, I have taken trips to Utah, California, New York, and Florida, so I would have no problem relocating for work. I love meeting new people for social connections and networking. </p>
